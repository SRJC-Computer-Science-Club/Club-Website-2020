Note: the changes sometimes will not populate emiditly, it take time for github to push the changes to the website.
Also if the page is still not changing after a few minutes, sometimes the browser cache will interfere with your browser making a nice and clean new request. to solve this (chrome) go into developer tools: right click on the page, or cmd + shift +i (mac) or ctrl + shift + i (windows).
